  <p> To whomever this reaches: thank you for watching Valentine! She is a sweetie but can definitely be a <strong> brat </strong> if her needs aren't met.  If you have any questions, you can reach me at <a href="tel:5752681568">(575) 268-1568 </a> or email me at <a href="mailto:menefee.kraig@gmail.com">menefee.kraig@gmail.com.</a> Thank you! </p>

<h2>Feeding</h2>
  <p> Valentine eats twice a day. Once in the morning (around 9-11am) and then again at night (6-8pm). She gets one of the metal scoops full of dry food and some wetfood as well :) </p>
  <p> She will always ask for treats. She loves peanut butter, meats, and her gingerbread treats :) </p>

<h2> Walking and Outside Time </h2>
  <p> Valentine uses a martingale harness to prevent her from slipping out and getting loose (shes slippery!). To ensure the best time out with her, double check that you attach the leash to the ring on the chained area. It should make the collar tighter as she pulls. Wrap the loop of the leash around your wrist for extra safety. She's a strong little gal! </p>


  <p> She loves to run around and hang outside. If you have time and energy, feel free to chill with her in the grass on her long leash :) </p>

<h2> Potty Schedule </h2>
  <p> Valentine typically loves to go outside multiple times a day :) I make the walks roughly 15 mins so she has time to do her business, but its fine to bring her in sooner if she seems like shes good! </p>
  <p> I typically bring her outside every 3 ish hours, so: </p>
  <li> 9am</li>
  <li>noon</li>
  <li>3pm</li> 
  <li>6pm</li>
  <li>9/before bed/after dinner. shes pretty flexible!</li>
<section>
<h2> Misc. </h2>
  <li> Potty bags can be found in her bone trinket on her main leash, and if she runs out, they can be found in the target bag on the door :)</li>
  <li> Her food is stored in a white tin with a brown lid. Her scoop should be found inside it. Her wet food is in the cabinet next to the fridge at the very top! </li>
  <li> She loves to roll around in the grass (and occasionally nasty stuff). Wet wipes above fridge can help clean her!</li>
