<h1> Valentine Guide! </h1>
    <p> To whomever this reaches: thank you for watching Valentine! She is a sweetie but can definitely be a <strong> brat </strong> if her needs aren't met.  If you have any questions, you can reach me at (575) 268-1568 or email me at menefee.kraig@gmail.com. Thank you! </p>

<h2><summary>Feeding</summary></h2>
  <p> Valentine eats twice a day. Once in the morning (around 9-11am) and then again at night (6-8pm). She gets one of the metal scoops full of dry food and some wetfood as well :) </p>
  <p> She will always ask for treats. She loves peanut butter, meats, and her gingerbread treats :) </p>
</details>
<h3>Bathroom Schedule</h3>
  
  <li> After Breakfast </li>
  <li> 1pm</li>
  <li> 4pm</li>
  <li> After Dinner</li>
  <li> and usually once before bed. If you feed her and take her out around 8, she should be good until the morning!</li>
<h4> Walking and Outside Time </h4>
<p> Valentine uses a martingale harness to prevent her from slipping out and getting loose (shes slippery!). To ensure the best time out with her, double check that you attach the leash to the ring on the chained area. It should make the collar tighter as she pulls. Wrap the loop of the leash around your wrist for extra safety. She's a strong little gal! </p>


<p> She loves to run around and hang outside. If you have time and energy, feel free to chill with her in the grass on her long leash :) </p>
