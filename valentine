  <h1> Valentine Guide! </h1>
  <p> To whomever this reaches: thank you for watching Valentine! She is a sweetie but can definitely be a <strong> brat </strong> if her needs aren't met.  If you have any questions, you can reach me at (575)268-1568 or email me at menefee.kraig@gmail.com. Thank you! </p> 
  <h2>Feeding</h2>
  <p> Valentine eats twice a day. Once in the morning (around 9-11am) and then again at night (6-8pm). She gets one of the metal scoops full of dry food and some wetfood as well :) </p>
  <p> She will always ask for treats. She loves peanut butter, meats, and her gingerbread treats :) </p>
